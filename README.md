## My process

### Built with

- HTML/CSS 
- SASS - For styles
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS Library (react-router-dom, react-select)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/components/icons/) - For Icons
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/) - For Countries Data

### What I learned

This is the first project I built with ReactJS. It helped me understand how it works and how to think in React. 
I was able to use different hook like (useState, useEffect, useRef or useContext) to problem solve.
